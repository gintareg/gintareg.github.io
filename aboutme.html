		     <h2>Here is my story :)</h2>
                     <p>I am a senior Business major student in LCC International University, so my life is just about to change in a few month. I will soon have to make many hard decisions about my future and move on towards how I image it to be. However, there are some aspects I have already started to change, and they are reduction of bad habits and taking care of my body and health.</p> 
                     <p>I have struggled a lot through my life to find a way to healthy lifestyle since my body started to lose its form because of increasing appetite and lack of physical activity. A few years ago I started to search for the best way to balance my passion for food with healthy diet and pleasurable sport activities. It is hard when you do not have time and really strong motivation. And I know that there are more people like me!</p>
