		    <h2>ABOUT BLOG</h2>
			<p>The blog is created to share my experience in the search of healthy lifestyle tips with YOU. I wish the blog motivates you to move on towards your goals. </p>
                        <p>In the section ABOUT ME you can read my story how I get where I am and what inspired me to create the blog, while in section DISCOVERIES I will post my latest finding in healthy eating and exercising area. I have learnt that HEALTHY FOOD can be TASTY as well! The best way to keep satisfied with your food is changing the recipes of your beloved meals into the most healthy versions of them by reducing fat and adding some protein and fiber. So check my blog and see my tasty and healthy versions of food! Physical activity is also very important so I will share new and interesting exercises I have found and felt they work.
